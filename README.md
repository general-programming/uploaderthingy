#  uploaderthingy

A horrible but 1/10ths working uploader for elixi.re for iOS.

Currently the app "works" standalone and with the share sheet for *most* images on iOS

## Getting this app
For now, compile it yourself and substitute your elixi.re API key in UploadHelper.swift if the Settings pane hasn't been implemented yet.

This will probably go onto TestFlight later if it becomes less awful.

## Development
**Good luck.**

As of the writing of this README, only native modules and XCode 11 Beta 4 is used for the project.

CocoaPods was used at the beginning but the external module was yoinked out in favor of native modules.
